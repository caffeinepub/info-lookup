  "summary": "The diff implements the single-page tabbed UI with Number Info and Vehicle Info panels, uses React Query hooks to call the specified public APIs with caching, and applies a dark terminal-themed styling while referencing the required generated images. However, the required generated image files themselves are not shown as added, and the diff introduces Internet Identity/auth-related hooks and an (empty) backend canister file, which were explicitly non-goals/constraints.",
